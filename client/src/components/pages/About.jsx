                I am a second-year industrial engineering student at the University of Toronto,

                I share a passion for both the arts and engineering.
                The different perspectives deriving from these two disciplines
                complements my ability to think creatively and come up with ideas
                to solve problems.

                Currently, I am in the process of learning the tools necessary
                to solve these problems through my engineering degree and by self-learning.
